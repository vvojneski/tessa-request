🛡️ Project Prompt: Step-by-Step Penetration Testing Request Form (Astro + Backend)

Objective:
Build a secure, multi-step web form using Astro that collects detailed scoping information for penetration testing services. The form must guide users through a structured questionnaire, persist submissions in a database, and automatically notify stakeholders via Slack and email with a complete summary.
🔧 Technical Requirements

    Frontend Framework: Built with Astro (SSR or hybrid mode as needed).
    Form Flow: Multi-screen, step-by-step wizard UI (progress indicator required).
    State Management: Use Astro’s built-in capabilities or lightweight client-side state (e.g., astro:client-only + React/Vue if necessary) to preserve form data across steps.
    Validation: Client-side validation per step + server-side validation on submission.
    Backend Integration:
        A lightweight API route (e.g., using Astro’s API endpoints or integrated with a backend like Express, Hono, or serverless function) to handle form submission.
        Store all entries in a secure database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite—your choice; ensure GDPR/privacy compliance).
    Notifications:
        On successful submission, send a formatted summary of the entire form to:
            A designated Slack channel (via Incoming Webhook or Slack API).
            One or more configured email addresses (via SMTP or transactional email service like SendGrid, Resend, or Nodemailer).
    Security:
        Implement CSRF protection.
        Sanitize and escape all user inputs.
        Rate-limit submissions to prevent abuse.
        Do not expose internal logic or debug info in production.

📝 Form Content & Structure

The form consists of 17 main sections (some conditional). Organize them into logical steps (e.g., 5–7 screens):
✅ Suggested Step Grouping:

    Intro & Test Type Selection  
        Business requirement (regulatory vs. proactive)  
        Penetration test type(s): Black/Gray/White Box, Social Engineering, or All
    Scope & Awareness  
        Short business/app description  
        Owner awareness (Yes/No)  
        In-scope IPs/apps list
    Target Definition  
        Target type (Website, Web App, Mobile, Network, Wireless, People, etc.)  
        “Other” elaboration field (conditional)  
        Production environment confirmation + warning acknowledgment
    External Testing Details (show only if external testing selected)  
        IT Infrastructure (Q9)  
        Web Apps (Q10)  
        Mobile Apps (Q11)
    Internal Testing Details (show only if internal testing selected)  
        Internal IT Infra (Q13)  
        Desktop Apps (Q14)  
        Internal Web Apps (Q15)  
        Wireless Networks (Q16 + box type)
    Social Engineering (if selected)  
        Number of employee targets
    Scheduling Preferences  
        Preferred test timing (business hours, after-hours, weekend, maintenance window, other)  
        “Other” elaboration field (conditional)

    ⚠️ Conditional Logic: Fields should appear/disappear based on prior selections (e.g., if “Mobile Apps” is not a target, skip Q11).

🎨 UX/UI Expectations

    Clean, professional, tech-forward design (dark/light mode optional).
    Progress bar or step counter at top.
    “Back” and “Next” navigation with data persistence.
    Final review screen before submission.
    Success message + redirect after submit.
    Mobile-responsive layout.

📬 Notification Format

Both Slack and email messages must include:

    Timestamp of submission
    Full answers in a readable, structured format (use headings, bullet points)
    Highlight critical fields (e.g., production environment = YES)
    Include contact context if available (IP, user-agent optional for audit)

🚀 Deliverables

    Fully functional Astro project (GitHub repo or zip)
    Database schema (SQL file or ORM model)
    .env template with required keys (Slack webhook, SMTP, DB URL)
    Brief README with setup instructions
    Optional: Dockerfile for easy deployment
